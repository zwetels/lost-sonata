###### The devil at the window
Keeps knocking on the frame
And scratching at the glass
And calling out my name

No rest for my eyes
Nor rest for my mind
Until I can accept
The devil I designed

But of what is he made
And why is he here
The hairs on my neck
Stand when he is near

He must be important
Or I wouldn’t be scared
Or maybe he wouldn’t be
If I just never cared

But I can’t not care
His gaze fills my room
Intense--
Is this feeling of doom

Go away, leave
I just want some sleep
I don’t understand
Why you stay and weep

Are you my doing?
Perhaps a lost piece
Of a thought I forgot
And never made peace

When I think of you
I know you are lost
And so am I
But lost from what

Is there a path
That we have to follow
Are there really some truths
That must be swallowed

Or can I ignore them
And close my eyes
And let them pass
As I let out cries

Cries of lost time
And cries of fear
All in my head
Without a sound to hear
